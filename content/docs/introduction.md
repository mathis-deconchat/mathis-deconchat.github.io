# What is this  ? 
## Goals
This site has 3 main goals : 
1. Keep in a centralized way all my knowledge, snippets of code, and other things I want to keep track of.
2. Share my knowledge with others and maybe help some people along the way
3. Showcase my skills and what I can do and be able to explain it.

In no way, all informations on this site are meant to be taken as the absolute truth. I am not an absolute expert in any of the fields I talk about, and I am still learning. I am just sharing what I know and what I learn along the way.
{{< alert context="info" text="If you find anything incorrect, misleading or uncomplete, please open a GitHub issue " />}}

Also, I'll will not state the obvious; for example, I won't explain what 
```sql 
SELECT * FROM table
```
does. I will assume you already know the basics of what you're doing.
But I will integrate informations easily available on internet. The goal of this site is to be a centralized place for me, and for you, to find informations about a specific topic, and avois the 100's tabs opened to find how to create a VM with Terraform üòâ.

## Context
I am a 25 years old French (yes) student, completing my master degree this year. I've been in a work-study path for the last 6 years. I started as a System Administrator on Windows, automating (everything) with powershell ‚ù§Ô∏è.<br> And then moved to a software developper role, working with **Angular**, **Graphql**, **Nodejs** and **"Nestjs** on multiple projects. <br> <br>Then I've been doing more DevOps tasks, working with **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, **Terraform**, **Kong**, **Keycloak**, **OpenStack** and many more. 

{{< alert context="warning" text="I've been using debian based OS since many years, all of my documentation will mainly assume you're using one too. Nothing against the bloated, spyware that is Windows " />}}

## Content type 
I will mainly write about **DevOps** and **Software Development**. But I will also try to write about **Linux**, **Networking**, **Security** and **Cloud**. <br>
There will be different types of content :
- **Guides** : How to do something, step by step, with explanations and examples
- **Snippets** : Small pieces of code, or configuration, that I want to keep track of
- **Reviews** : Reviews of tools, tech or anything else that I use and want to share my opinion on after researching on it


# What I'm trying to learn ? 
First of all, I'm trying to learn how to write. I'm not a native english speaker, and I'm not used to write a lot. So I'm trying to improve my writing skills, and my english skills at the same time. Even if IA helps me a lot, I'm aiming to write most of the content only by myself. <br>
<br>

## Technologies 
I have different techs I want to improve my skills in : 
1. GoLang, mainly for creating CLI tools and using it for microservices
2. Security, continuing to exercice on root.me and start to use HTB
3. Monioring, I already have a steady experience with Grafana monitoring stack, but I want to get better at it
4. eBPF, undertsanding how it works and how to use it with Kubernetes

And I also want to get my CKA and DCA during 2023.
