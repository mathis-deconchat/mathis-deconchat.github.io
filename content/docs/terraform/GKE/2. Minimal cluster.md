## Minimalist cluster
### Create cluster
Now, create a folder and add a `main.tf` file inside it and add this 15 lines of code:

```hcl {linenos=table,anchorlinenos=true}
provider "google" {
  project     = "tf-gke-396804"
  region      = "europe-west9"
}

resource "google_container_cluster" "gke_cluster" {
  name               = "gke-cluster"
  location           = "europe-west9"
  initial_node_count = 3

  node_config {
    machine_type = "e2-medium"
    disk_size_gb = 20
  }
}
```

{{< alert context="info" 
text="For simplicity purpose, set an alias `alias tf='terraform'` in your bash profile, or replace `tf` with `terraform` in the following commands." />}}

Then run the following commands:
```bash
tf init
tf plan
tf apply -auto-approve
```
Refer to the 
[intro]({{< ref "/docs/terraform/intro.md" >}}) 
if you don't understand what's happening and what result should you see.

After `tf apply -auto-approve`, it should take around 5-10 minutes before you see : 
```bash
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

We can check if the cluster is up and running with the following command:
```bash
gcloud container clusters list
```
And the output should be something like this:
```bash
NAME         LOCATION      MASTER_VERSION  MASTER_IP      MACHINE_TYPE  NODE_VERSION    NUM_NODES  STATUS
gke-cluster  europe-west9  1.27.3-gke.100  34.155.108.14  e2-medium     1.27.3-gke.100  3          RUNNING
```

### Get credentials
Now, we need to get the credentials of the cluster to be able to interact with it. 
```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials gke-cluster --region europe-west9
```
The output will be a file in ~/.kube/config. You can check it with `cat ~/.kube/config`

### Destroy cluster
Then destroy it with 
```bash
tf destroy -auto-approve
```
