## Deploy Cluster
### Directory Structure
Create an empty directory and inside create two files : 
- `main.tf`
- `provider.tf`

```bash
touch main.tf provider.tf
```

### Provider
In the `provider.tf` file, add the following content : 

```hcl 
terraform {
  required_providers {
    k3d = {
      source = "nikhilsbhat/k3d"
      version = "0.0.2"
    }
  }
}

provider "k3d" {

    kubernetes_version = "1.24.4-k3s1"
    k3d_api_version    = "k3d.io/v1alpha4"
    registry           = "rancher/k3s"
    kind               = "Simple"
    runtime            = "docker"
}
```
We use a very early version of the provider (0.0.2), it might be subject to breaking changes in the future.
Also, we use custom version of Kubernetes (1.24.4-k3s1) and the k3d API (k3d.io/v1alpha4). It doesn't come from the official Kubernetes image repo.

### Cluster
It's very straightforward to create a cluster with k3d. In the `main.tf` file, add the following content : 

```hcl
resource "k3d_cluster" "sample_cluster" {
  name          = "default"
  servers_count = 1
  agents_count  = 2
  kube_api {
    host_ip   = "0.0.0.0"
    host_port = 6445
  }

  ports {
    host_port      = 8081
    container_port = 80
    node_filters = [
      "loadbalancer",
    ]
  }

  k3d_options {
    no_loadbalancer = false
    no_image_volume = false
  }

  kube_config {
    update_default = true
    switch_context = true
  }
}
```
Server count =  number of masters in the cluster
Agent count = number of workers in the cluster

### Deploy
Now that we have our cluster defined, we can deploy it as usual : 

```bash
tf init 
tf plan
tf apply
```

Since we have `switch_context = true` in our `kube_config` block, we can use `kubectl` immediatly to interact with our cluster : 

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
